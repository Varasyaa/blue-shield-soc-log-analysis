Blue-Shield SOC Log Analytics, Threat Hunting &amp; IR System Aug - Nov 2025 - Built a SOC log analysis pipeline using Sysmon, Zeek, and Suricata integrated with Wazuh SIEM to detect common security attacks. Automated basic threat detection and response workflows using Python with visual monitoring through Kibana dashboards.

# Blue-Shield SOC Log Analytics & IR System

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic SOC log analysis pipeline for detecting common security threats.

## Tools Used
- Sysmon (system logs)
- Zeek (network logs)
- Suricata (IDS alerts)
- Wazuh SIEM (conceptual integration)
- Python (automation)
- Kibana (visualization)

## How It Works
1. Sample logs are collected from different sources.
2. Python scripts analyze logs for suspicious patterns.
3. Alerts are generated for potential attacks.
4. Results can be visualized using dashboards.

## Note
This is a demo project using sample logs for learning purposes.
No real malware or live systems are involved.
